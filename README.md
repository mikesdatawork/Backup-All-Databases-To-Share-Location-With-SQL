## About-Process

<p>Here's a quick script that will backup all databases to a shared location on the network. The database backup files will be titled like this: MyDatabaseName.bak There is some extra logic to replace apostrophe's in the database name in case you have any. I don't know why you would have them, but I just found a box that does, so I included that in there. Additionally; this will not backup the system databases. Only user databases are backed up.</p> 


## SQL-Logic
```SQL
use master;
set nocount on
declare @backup_all_databases varchar(max)
set @backup_all_databases = ''
select @backup_all_databases = @backup_all_databases +
'backup database [' + name + '] to disk = ''\\MyShareName\' + replace(name, '', '''') + '.bak'' with format;' + char(10)
from sys.databases where name not in ('tempdb') 
order by name asc
exec (@backup_all_databases)

```
